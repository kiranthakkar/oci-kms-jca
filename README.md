# oci-kms-jca

This project provides JCE provider OCI vault and certificates service. 

## Getting started

### Pre-requisites

1. [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/)
2. [OCI Cli](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm)

## Add your files

- [ ] [Create](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#create-a-file) or [upload](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#upload-a-file) files
- [ ] [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html#add-a-file-using-the-command-line) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://orahub.oci.oraclecorp.com/ateam/oic-kms-jce.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```

## Installation
You can use the library in your Java application or use the jar file with Java utilities like keytool and jarsigner. 

You can find more details instructions from

keytool blog link (TBD)
jarsigner blog ling (TBD)

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Roadmap
I am planning to add following updates to the library over next few months.

1. Adding automated build process
2. Adding test classes 
3. Support non default profiles and instance principal for OCI Integration
